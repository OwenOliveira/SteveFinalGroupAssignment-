# SteveFinalGroupAssignment-

PROG71985F22 - Group Assignment
Check eConestoga for due date.
Introduction
Working in groups of either 2 or 3 (You have either sent Prof Steve your group
membership requests or you have no preference and you have been ’randomly’ assigned to a group), you will design and write a program that fulfills the functionality
described below.

Groups will submit a single programming assignment that is the result of their
combined efforts. The submission should be a compressed file containing all the
artifacts required to fulfill the assignment requirements. Please be sure to include
all your testing code and test cases. Again, the format of Assignment 1 (less the
screenshots) is recommended.

Please keep in mind that as we progress, I am looking for clean, parsimonious
(only that which is required, no extra anything), and well-designed code. It is not
enough just to spaghetti-code until the requirements are met.

Finally, the assessment rubric has changed for this and all future assignments. Please review the rubric illustrated below.
Specification
Each group member will receive the identical grade on the programming assignment except in escalated cases which are reported before the assignment due date.
(Please connect with Professor Steve if there are serious issues within your team).
Each member will describe their division of labor in a single README file which is
located in the solution directory.

Each member may also turn in a short, private statement (via email to professor) of
what role they took in the programming assignment and what role their partner(s)
took.

All members are expected to understand the entirety of the code, and questions
pertaining to this assignment may be assigned on the exam or via a verbal interview
with Professor Steve to ensure this.

1
The program your group will write will be one of:
1. a calendar/appointment manager
2. a to-do/task manager
3. a recipe (as in cooking) manager
4. (some other) activity manager **you must get prior approval from
professor *before* choosing this option**
Your program must have the following mandatory features:
1. add a new appt/task/recipe/other
2. delete an existing appt/task/recipe/other
3. update an existing appt/task/recipe/other
4. display single appt/task/recipe/other
5. display range appt/task/recipe/other
6. display all appt/task/recipe/other
7. search for appt/task/recipe/other
8. friendly/easy to use UI (or menu system)
9. save accumulated data to disk
10. load accumulated data from disk
11. you may add additional features, increasing your group’s overall
mark to a maximum of 100%.
Program Organization
• modules properly separated and coded into .h and .c files
• modules should be commented according to class practices and include who
authored and/or the principal editor of the module
• build instructions should be included (or obvious (e.g. a single VS solution))
• wherever used, tests (unit or otherwise) should be properly documented and
included
2
Deliverable
One of your team will submit a single zip file containing:
• source code and build instructions (if required)
• a README file including division of labour within the group
• any tests or test cases that you used
Marking Rubric Evaluation of this program will be broken into 2 sections, one
worth 25% of the final mark, the other worth 75% of final mark.

For the 25% section:
10% For overall user friendliness and usability (as much as this
is subjective, the screens, menus, and/or messages should be
well-written. 
The program flow should be logical and intuitive)
10% For the design and internal layout/structure of your program,
including any and all ADTs.

5% For division of work and the documenting of those different
roles (having a well-balanced work effort and being able to
articulate how your group was able to achieve this balance is
important)

For the 75% section, the actual implementation of the program, the following rubric
will be used:
4 3 2 1
Specifications
(x2 multiplier)
The program works and
meets all of the specifications.
(8 points)

The program works and
produces the correct results and displays them
correctly. It also meets
most of the other specifications.
(6 points)

The program produces correct results but does not
display them correctly.
(4 points)

The program is producing
incorrect results.
(2 points)

Readability The code is exceptionally
well organized and very
easy to follow.
The code is fairly easy to
read.

The code is readable only
by someone who knows
what it is supposed to be
doing.

The code is poorly organized and very difficult to
read.

Reusability The code could be reused
as a whole or each routine
could be reused.

Most of the code could be
reused in other programs.

Some parts of the code
could be reused in other
programs.

The code is not organized
for reusability.

Documentation The documentation is well
written and clearly explains what the code is accomplishing and how.
The documentation consists of embedded comment and some simple
header documentation that
is somewhat useful in understanding the code.
The documentation is simply comments embedded in
the code with some simple
header comments separating routines. The program
is producing incorrect results.
The documentation is simply comments embedded in
the code and does not help
the reader understand the
code.

Standard deductions
• 100% for submissions ’packaged’ (archived, compressed, etc) using a tool other
3
than standard, built-in Windows compressed file tool.
• 100% for any question that can not be built (due to insufficient instruction or
missing dependencies) from source during marking.
• Regular late submission penalty (see Program Handbook)
• Penalties applied as per the Student Handbook for any plagiarism and/or
academic dishonesty.
